Xadow - IMU 6DOF is a motion tracking module. Its design is based on the sensor MPU6050 which is the world’s first integrated 6-axis MotionTracking device, that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP). MPU6050 features three 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing the gyroscope outputs and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs so Xadow - IMU 6DOF achieves a high converter accuracy. For precision tracking of both fast and slow motions, the parts feature a user-programmable gyroscope full-scale range and a user-programmable accelerometer full-scale range.


### Usage:

This is library of Xadow - IMU 6DOF, there's an example that can make you start this xadow quickly.
